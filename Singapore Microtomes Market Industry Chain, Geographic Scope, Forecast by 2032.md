# Singapore Microtomes Market Industry Chain, Geographic Scope, Forecast by 2032

<strong>Microtomes Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

A microtome (from the Greek mikros, meaning &#34;small&#34;, and temnein, meaning &#34;to cut&#34;) is a tool used to cut extremely thin slices of material, known as sections. Important in science, microtomes are used in microscopy, allowing for the preparation of samples for observation under transmitted light or electron radiation. Microtomes use steel, glass, or diamond blades depending upon the specimen being sliced and the desired thickness of the sections being cut. Steel blades are used to prepare sections of animal or plant tissues for light microscopy histology. Glass knives are used to slice sections for light microscopy and to slice very thin sections for electron microscopy. Industrial grade diamond knives are used to slice hard materials such as bone, teeth and plant matter for both light microscopy and for electron microscopy. Gem quality diamond knives are used for slicing thin sections for electron microscopy.
