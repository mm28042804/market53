<strong>Crude Oil Desalter and Electrostatic Dehydrator Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Crude oil desalting technology is used to remove residual salts from crude oil so that it can be processed in a refinery without corroding and fouling heaters, exchangers, and other equipment. Crude oil desalting is usually the initial process that is carried out during upstream operations. The type and size specification of the desalter is dependent on a few fundamental parameters such as temperature, pressure, fluid viscosity, and flow-rate, and customer specification pertaining to permissible salt in the final product. Dehydrating of crude oil is generally carried out at production stage to remove excess water from crude oil. Electrostatic dehydrators of combined AC-DC configuration are the most effective and are suitable for all grades of crude oil.
